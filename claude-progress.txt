# Claude Progress Report - Session 2 (Coding Agent)
Date: January 10, 2026

## Summary

and verified the initial features of the application.

## Completed Features (5 passing)

1. **Feature #1: App loads without errors** - PASSED
   - Application initializes and renders the main layout
   - No JavaScript errors in console
   - Three-panel layout renders (module panel, preview panel, content panel)
   - Header bar with logo, title, settings, save draft, and export buttons

2. **Feature #2: Three-panel layout structure** - PASSED
   - Module panel on the left with 300px fixed width
   - Preview panel on the right with fluid width
   - Content panel at the bottom (collapsible)
   - Header bar spans full width at the top

3. **Feature #3: Create New Page flow initiates correctly** - PASSED
   - Partner name input field appears
   - Template type selector dropdown with Learning Partner and Channel Partner options
   - Continue to Builder button enables when partner name is entered

4. **Feature #4: Edit Existing Page flow with URL input** - PASSED
   - URL input field appears when selecting Edit Existing Page
   - URL validation for supported CSU landing page patterns
   - Parse & Load Content button triggers URL parsing
   - Content extracted and app transitions to builder

5. **Feature #5: Load Draft flow with JSON file upload** - PASSED
   - File upload input with drag-and-drop interface
   - JSON file validation
   - State restoration from draft (partner name, template type)
   - Transitions to builder after successful load

## Code Changes

### src/App.tsx
- Added 'setup' mode to AppMode type for intermediate setup screens
- Added state for partnerName, templateType, sourceUrl, draftError, draftFileName
- Implemented handleSetupComplete for Create New flow
- Implemented handleUrlParse for Edit Existing flow with CSU URL validation
- Implemented handleDraftUpload for Load Draft flow with JSON parsing
- Created conditional rendering for all three setup forms
- Added SUPPORTED_URL_PATTERNS regex array for URL validation

## Current State
- Feature count: 144 (5 passing, 139 pending)
- Completion: 3.5%
- Dev server running on http://localhost:5173

## Next Steps
1. Continue with Feature #6 and beyond
2. Implement module panel with checkboxes for toggling modules
3. Implement drag-and-drop reordering of modules
4. Implement content forms for each module type
5. Implement live preview panel

# Claude Progress Report - Session 1 (Initializer Agent)
Date: January 10, 2025

## Summary
This session initialized the CSU Landing Page Builder project, setting up the foundation
for all future coding agents to build upon.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Feature Creation (144 features)
Created exactly 144 features in the features.db database using the feature_create_bulk API.
Features are organized by mandatory test categories:

- **Functional Features**: Core application functionality including:
  - App initialization and three-panel layout
  - Mode selection flows (Create New, Edit Existing, Load Draft)
  - Module management (toggle, drag-drop, locked modules)
  - All 17 selectable module forms and their content fields
  - Live preview with viewport switching and zoom
  - Draft management (save, load, auto-save, clear)
  - Export functionality (Wufoo text, HTML, ZIP, JSON)
  - URL parsing for existing CSU pages
  - Settings panel (header/footer style, dark mode, auto-save toggle)

- **Style Features**: Visual and UX requirements including:
  - CSU brand colors (Navy #002855, Gold #C6AA76)
  - Typography (Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif)
  - Responsive layouts (desktop, tablet, mobile)
  - Touch target sizes
  - Modal fit on mobile

- **Accessibility Features**: ARIA labels, color contrast, keyboard navigation

- **Data Integrity Features**: Real data persistence, no mock data

### 2. Project Structure
Created a complete React + TypeScript + Vite project with:
- `src/` directory with components, hooks, utils, types, assets, context folders
- `public/` directory for static assets
- Tailwind CSS configuration with CSU brand colors
- TypeScript configurations
- ESLint configuration
- PostCSS configuration for Tailwind

### 3. Initial Files Created
- `init.sh` - Development environment setup script
- `README.md` - Project documentation with setup instructions
- `package.json` - Dependencies including React, dnd-kit, JSZip, file-saver, Zustand
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind with CSU brand colors and module panel width
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite bundler configuration
- `src/App.tsx` - Basic application with mode selection and builder skeleton
- `src/types/index.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for all modules and state
- `src/index.css` - Base styles with Tailwind imports
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns

### 4. Git Repository
Initialized git repository with initial commit containing all project files.

## Current State
- Feature count: 144 (0 passing, 0 in progress)
- Project structure: Complete skeleton ready for implementation
- Dependencies: Defined in package.json but not yet installed

## Next Steps for Future Agents
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to start development server
3. Use `feature_get_next` to get highest priority feature
4. Implement features one by one, marking as passing when complete
5. Test thoroughly in browser before marking features as passing

## Technology Stack
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite for bundling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
- dnd-kit for drag-and-drop
- JSZip for asset bundling
- FileSaver.js for file downloads

## Notes
- The app is client-side only (no backend)
- Auto-save uses browser localStorage
- Draft files are JSON format
- Exports generate Wufoo text, HTML, ZIP, and JSON files
- URL parser supports specific CSU landing page URL patterns
