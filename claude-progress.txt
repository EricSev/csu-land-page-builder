- `public/` directory for static assets
- Tailwind CSS configuration with CSU brand colors
- TypeScript configurations
- ESLint configuration
- PostCSS configuration for Tailwind

### 3. Initial Files Created
- `init.sh` - Development environment setup script

- `package.json` - Dependencies including React, dnd-kit, JSZip, file-saver, Zustand
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind with CSU brand colors and module panel width
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite bundler configuration
- `src/App.tsx` - Basic application with mode selection and builder skeleton
- `src/types/index.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for all modules and state
- `src/index.css` - Base styles with Tailwind imports
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns

### 4. Git Repository
Initialized git repository with initial commit containing all project files.

## Current State
- Feature count: 144 (0 passing, 0 in progress)
- Project structure: Complete skeleton ready for implementation
- Dependencies: Defined in package.json but not yet installed

## Next Steps for Future Agents
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to start development server
3. Use `feature_get_next` to get highest priority feature
4. Implement features one by one, marking as passing when complete
5. Test thoroughly in browser before marking features as passing

## Technology Stack
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite for bundling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
- dnd-kit for drag-and-drop
- JSZip for asset bundling
- FileSaver.js for file downloads

## Notes
- The app is client-side only (no backend)
- Auto-save uses browser localStorage
- Draft files are JSON format
- Exports generate Wufoo text, HTML, ZIP, and JSON files
- URL parser supports specific CSU landing page URL patterns
